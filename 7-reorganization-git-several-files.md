# Reorganization: using Git and separating the code into different files

*Date: October 25, 2023*.

The code of ViperMate is now divided into several .cpp files, each associated with a main topic: search.cpp, evaluation.cpp and so on...

I'm the kind of amateur developer who never paid much attention to professional standards of coding style or organization, so my code has always been incredibly messy. The only aspect I was ever interested in was "optimization".

Still, reorganizing all the code was a necessary step to get closer to the not-so-distant release of a beta version of the engine.

I've also used this reorganization to learn what Git is and how it works. I hate it and its incomprehensible nomenclature. It seems like an unnecessary complication that could have been avoided by choosing names and words already adopted by the programming community. But I understand how convenient Git can be, so I have accepted its environment as a necessary evil.
