# A journal for the ViperMate chess engine

![ViperMate logo](/images/vipermate-logo.png)

**ViperMate** is my pet project: developing a **chess engine**.

My only goals are to *learn* the themes of chess programming and *have fun* by focusing on the activity that I like most: algorithm and code optimization. No expectations, no stress, just enjoying the journey.

This journal documents the path taken so far.
